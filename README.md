# Fooling Your Deep Neural Networks with Torchattacks
A simple demo for Python Conference Indonesia 2021<br>

![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8.1-blue.svg)

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats<br>
I'm only take the data in **train.zip**.<br>
I'm also take the 258 images for data test and 606 images for data train due to memory and time limitation :p<br>
You're free to change the amount of the data (if you want) for you self-experiment, as well.

## How to:
1. Create your virtual environment<br>
`$ virtualenv .venv`
2. Activate it<br>
`$ source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the third party libraries<br>
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Have fun!
